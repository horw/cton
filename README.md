# Learn Chinese Tones

An interactive web application designed to help language learners practice and master the four tones of Mandarin Chinese through engaging activities and visual feedback.

## Features

- **Introduction to Chinese Tones**: Learn about the four main tones and neutral tone in Mandarin Chinese with enhanced visual representations.
- **Practice Individual Tones**: Select specific tones to practice with example characters and accurate tone patterns.
- **Tone Pairs Practice**: Practice challenging tone combinations with audio guidance.
- **Interactive Quiz Mode**: Test your knowledge of tones with a scoring system that rewards streaks.
- **Audio Pronunciation**: Hear the correct pronunciation of characters with optimized speech parameters for each tone.
- **Voice Practice**: Use your microphone to practice pronunciation and receive feedback (browser permissions required).
- **Tone Matching Game**: Test your memory and tone recognition with a fun matching card game.
- **Interactive Tone Visualizer**: See accurate tone patterns and create your own by drawing on the canvas.

## Technology

This application is built with:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## How to Use

1. Run the server with `python server.py` to start the application on port 8081.
2. Navigate through the different sections to learn and practice Chinese tones.
3. Use the tone selector to focus on specific tones and hear their pronunciation.
4. Practice tone pairs that are typically challenging for learners.
5. Test your knowledge with the interactive quiz section and earn points for correct answers.
6. Use the microphone feature to practice your own pronunciation (if your browser supports it).
7. Play the tone matching game to reinforce your tone recognition skills.
8. Experiment with the interactive tone visualizer to understand tone patterns better.

## Audio and Microphone Support

The application uses the Web Speech API for pronunciation and microphone input. For the best experience:
- Use a modern browser that supports the Web Speech API and microphone access (Chrome, Edge, Safari).
- Make sure your device has audio output enabled.
- Grant microphone permissions when prompted for the voice practice feature.
- If your browser doesn't support microphone access, you'll still be able to use most features with a fallback experience.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more characters and examples for each tone.
- Include more complex tone combinations and sentences.
- Implement a comprehensive progress tracking system with user accounts.
- Enhance the voice recognition feature with machine learning for more accurate feedback.
- Add a spaced repetition system for optimized learning.
- Create a mobile app version with offline capabilities.
- Add more interactive games and activities for varied practice methods.
